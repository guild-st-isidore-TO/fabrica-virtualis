# Module Ideas

## CODE REUSE

Integrating previous works as FAVI modules

### Calendarium Interretialum

Still not sure how to really start this project, but we can integrate code from

`rjsalvadorr/routinetrax`  
_"paper-based habits tracking, supercharged"_

`salvador-workshop/annual-planner`  
_"Calendar generator for annual planner booklet"_

and maybe come up with something

### Image Processing Tools

??? ??? - GSI's image processing tools.

This reuses the code from

`salvador-workshop/picsmith`  
_"PicSmith is Salvador Workshop's image processing tool"_

### Guitar Diagram Lib/Tools

??? ??? - GSI's guitar diagram library and tools.

This reuses the code from

`salvador-workshop/guitarragrams`
